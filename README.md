shape-pov
=========

ATM, this is a script to write shapefiles to PovRay docs for rendering.  Long-term, will be a tile renderer with 3D support and more.

What's more?  Well, compositing in tilemill and all the mapnik derivatives is cool, this tool will handle true material properties, including subsurface scattering, glass like tranparency, diffusion, refraction, and a range of other sophisticated optical effects.

Stay tuned... .

BTW, will likely be ported from a BASH script to Postgres/PostGIS functions in the future.  This is just the (not yet functional) rapid development version.
